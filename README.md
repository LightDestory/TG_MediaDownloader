## Why should I use a MTProto bot? üßê

   MTProto clients connect directly to Telegram‚Äôs servers, which means there is no HTTP connection, no ‚Äúpolling‚Äù or ‚Äúweb hooks‚Äù. This means less overhead, since the protocol used between you and the server is much more compact than HTTP requests with responses in wasteful JSON.

   Since there is a direct connection to Telegram‚Äôs servers, even if their Bot API endpoint is down, you can still have connection to Telegram directly.

   Using a MTProto client, you are also not limited to the public API that they expose, and instead, you have full control of what your bot can do.

   __HTTP Bots can't download file bigger than 10mb meanwhile MTProto can download files of 1.5~2GB!__

## How to use üß†

After the setup the bot is ready to use, send/forward any supported media to the bot to download on local storage.

The bot supports the following commands:
| Command   | Role                                                                                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/start`  | Initial command (invoked by Telegram) when you start the chat with the bot for the first time. |
| `/help`   | Gives you the available commands list.                                                         |
| `/about`  | Gives you information about the project.                                                       |
| `/abort`  | Cancel all the pending downloads.                                                              |

You can run the bot inside a Docker container or directly on your PC/Server OS.

### Docker üêã

 If you want to containerize the bot, just pull or build a image and provide the requires env-vars.

 _Make sure that the download path is a mounted as a volume to allow the host system to access the downloaded files._

### Barebone üñ•Ô∏è

   If you want to run the bot directly on your PC/Server OS, do the following:

   0) Make sure to have Python 3.6+ installed on your system;
   1) Create a folder anywhere on your pc and clone the repository there:

      `git clone https://github.com/LightDestory/TG_MediaDownloader`

   2) Install the requirements using pip:

      `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   3) Execute the bot and follow the wizard to provide the env-vars:

      `python ./tg_downloader.py`


## Generating Telegram API keys

Before working with Telegram's API, you need to get your own API ID and hash:

1. Go to [My Telegram](https://my.telegram.org/) and login with your phone number;
2. Click under API Development tools;
3. A _Create new application_ window will appear. Fill in your application details. There is no need to enter any _URL_, and only the first two fields (_App title_ and _Short name_) can currently be changed later;
4. Click on _Create application_ at the end. Remember that your __API ID and API Hash are secrets__ and Telegram won't let you revoke it. __Don't post it anywhere!__

## Creating a Telegram Bot

1. Open a conversation with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) in Telegram
2. Use the /newbot command to create a new bot. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username, then generate an authorization token for your new bot.

   * The name of your bot is displayed in contact details and elsewhere.
   * The Username is a short name, to be used in mentions and telegram.me links. Usernames are 5-32   characters long and are case-insensitive, but may only include Latin characters, numbers, and underscores. Your bot`s username must end in ‚Äòbot‚Äô, e.g. ‚Äòtetris_bot‚Äô or ‚ÄòTetrisBot‚Äô.
   * The token is a string along the lines of 110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw that is required to authorize the bot and send requests to the Bot API. Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.
