## :book: About The Project

A telegram bot based on [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram) that downloads on a local storage the following
media files: _animation, audio, document, photo, video, voice_.

_The bot is inspired from the [Telethon-based](https://github.com/rodriguezst/telethon_downloader) bot
by [rodriguezst](https://github.com/rodriguezst)._

### Why should I use a MTProto bot?

MTProto clients connect directly to Telegram‚Äôs servers, which means there is no HTTP connection, no ‚Äúpolling‚Äù or ‚Äúweb hooks‚Äù. This means less overhead, since the protocol used between you and the server is much more compact than HTTP requests with responses in wasteful JSON.

Since there is a direct connection to Telegram‚Äôs servers, even if their Bot API endpoint is down, you can still have connection to Telegram directly.

Using a MTProto client, you are also not limited to the public API that they expose, and instead, you have full control of what your bot can do.

HTTP Bots can't download file bigger than 10mb meanwhile MTProto can download files of 1.5~4GB!

<details>
      <summary>Docker</summary>
        To dockerize the bot, just pull or build the image and provide the required parameters.<br/><br>
        An official GitHub Package is
        available <a href="https://github.com/LightDestory/TG_MediaDownloader/pkgs/container/        tg_mediadownloader">here</a>.<br/><br/>
        <i>Make sure that the download path is a mounted as a volume to allow the host system to access the downloaded files.</i>
</details>

<details>
      <summary>Barebone</summary>
        To run the bot directly on your PC/Server OS, do the following steps:

  
1) Make sure to have Python 3.10+ installed on your system;
2) Create a folder anywhere on your pc and clone the repository there:

   `git clone https://github.com/LightDestory/TG_MediaDownloader`

3) Install the requirements (create a `venv` if you don't want to dirty the system packages): 

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4) Execute the bot and follow the wizard to provide the requires parameters:

   `python ./tg_downloader.py`

### Usage

After the setting up process, the bot is ready to use. Send/forward any supported media to the bot to start the download on your local storage.

The bot supports the following commands:
| Command | Role |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/start`  | Initial command (invoked by Telegram) when you start the chat with the bot for the first time. |
| `/help`   | Gives you the available commands list. |
| `/about`  | Gives you information about the project. |
| `/abort`  | Cancel all the pending downloads. |
| `/status` | Gives you the current configuration. |
| `/usage`  | Gives you the usage instructions. |
| `/set_download_dir`  | Sets a new download dir. |
| `/set_max_parallel_dl`  | Sets the number of max parallel downloads. |

### Generating Telegram API keys

To make the bot work you must provide your own API ID and hash:

1. Go to [My Telegram](https://my.telegram.org/) and login with your phone number;
2. Click under API Development tools;
3. A _Create new application_ window will appear. Fill in your application details. There is no need to enter any _URL_,
   and only the first two fields (_App title_ and _Short name_) can currently be changed later;
4. Click on _Create application_ at the end. Remember that your __API ID and API Hash are secrets__ and Telegram won't
   let you revoke it. __Don't post it anywhere!__

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Creating a Telegram Bot

1. Open a conversation with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) in Telegram
2. Use the /newbot command to create a new bot. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username, then it will generate an
   authorization token for your new bot.

    * The name of your bot is displayed in contact details and elsewhere.
    * The Username is a short name, to be used in mentions and telegram.me links. Usernames are 5-32 characters long and
      are case-insensitive, but may only include Latin characters, numbers, and underscores. Your bot`s username must
      end in ‚Äòbot‚Äô, e.g. ‚Äòtetris_bot‚Äô or ‚ÄòTetrisBot‚Äô.
    * The token is a string along the lines of 110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw that is required to
      authorize the bot and send requests to the Bot API. Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by
      anyone to control your bot.
